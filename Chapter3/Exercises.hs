-- Undefined
-- My Response: Because undefined works for all types and function is also a type.
-- Answer: why are there so many different ways to define an expression using undefined”.
--         Since undefined can be used anywhere, for an expression of any type, it’s extremely flexible.
--         You can use undefined almost anywhere, to fill in for almost anything, even things that wouldn’t ever make sense with real code.
--         That’s one of the drawbacks of this technique.
--         When you allow the compiler to infer the type of undefined, you may find that you’re getting a false sense of security when your program compiles.
--         It’s useful frequently enough that you shouldn’t necessarily avoid it altogether, but beware of the drawbacks.
